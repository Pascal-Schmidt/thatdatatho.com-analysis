# thatdatatho.com-analysis

- For this mini project, I pulled data from my Google Analytics account, including information about my own website (thatdatatho.com), into R with the help of the `googleAnalyticsR` package.
- I evaluated the progress I have made since 2018 with the help of some data transformations and data visualizations.
